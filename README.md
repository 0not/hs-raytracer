# hs-raytracer: A simple Haskell ray tracer

This ray tracer is a work-in-progress. Most of the techniques are based on those in the booklet [_Ray Tracing In One Weekend_](http://www.realtimerendering.com/raytracing/Ray%20Tracing%20in%20a%20Weekend.pdf) by Peter Shirley. See also my C++ [ray tracer](https://github.com/0not/raytracer).
